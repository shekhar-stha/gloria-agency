                    1. Understanding the Parts of Medicare
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Medicare is divided into four parts, each playing a vital role:

                <ul>
                    <li>Part A (Hospital Insurance): Covers hospitalizations, hospice care, and services in skilled
                        nursing facilities.</li>
                    <li>Part B (Medical Insurance): Includes outpatient care, doctor visits, preventive services, and
                        home health care.</li>
                    <li>Part C (Medicare Advantage): A comprehensive plan offered by private insurance companies,
                        combining the coverage of Part A, Part B, and often Part D.</li>
                    <li>Part D (Prescription Drug Coverage): Focuses on prescription drug coverage, provided by private
                        insurance companies.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                It is important to mention how we are eligible for the benefits of Medicare. When you have worked
                and paid into social security for 10 years, Part A Medicare has no monthly premium, but you will
                have copays for services provided to you. You also are eligible to enroll in Part B for a monthly
                premium. In 2024 most Medicare beneficiaries will pay a $174.90 monthly premium. If a spouse has
                worked the required time, the other spouse can apply for Medicare based on the time of the working
                spouse. People who are younger than 65 with certain disabilities or people with certain chronic
                health conditions such as ESRD (End Stage Renal Disease) may also be eligible to enroll in Medicare.

                <h3>
                    2. Enrollment Periods
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Knowing the enrollment period is essential to avoid penalties. The Initial Enrollment Period (IEP)
                    begins three months before turning 65 and lasts seven months. You do have access to other enrollment
                    windows such as the Annual Enrollment (AEP) that runs from Oct 7th to Dec.15th every year for you to
                    make changes to your Medicare coverage. It is important to be your own advocate for the healthcare
                    coverage you need based on what you are experiencing each year.You do not want to miss the various
                    election period windows to make the changes that can provide the most effective coverage you need.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    While Medicare covers a variety of medical expenses, there are additional options to
                    consider.Medicare Supplement Insurance Plans (Medigap) can help fill the gaps in Original Medicare
                    (Part A and Part B) coverage. Medicare Advantage (Part C) is a comprehensive option offered
                    by private insurance companies. It combines the coverage of Part A and Part B, often including
                    additional benefits like vision, dental, and prescription drug coverage (Part D).Explore these
                    options based on your health needs.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The official Medicare website (medicare.gov) is a valuable tool, serving as your compass in the vast
                    landscape of healthcare options. Not only does it provide tools to compare plans and find healthcare
                    providers, but it also acts as a portal to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
                    website. Regular visits to both sites keep you informed about changes to benefit services, ensuring
                    you stay up-to-date with the latest developments in Medicare offerings. By staying well-informed,
                    you empower yourself to make decisions aligned with your evolving healthcare needs.

                    Participating in annual wellness visits and preventive care is not just a healthcare routine; it’s a
                    proactive investment in your well-being. Medicare covers a variety of preventive services,ranging
                    from essential health screenings to vaccinations that safeguard your health. Embracing preventive
                    care contributes not only to the longevity of your life but also to the quality of those additional
